# Rock-Paper-Scissors in C#

## Overview
This is a simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in C#. It allows the user to play against the computer in multiple rounds, keeping track of wins, losses, and draws. The game continues until the user decides to quit.

This project serves as a stepping stone for learning C#, covering fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Random number generation (`Random` class)
- Loops (`while`, `do-while`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
- Arrays and string manipulation
- Console input and output

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you need:
- .NET SDK installed
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or any text editor)
